# Idena affiliate program

To encourage and reward Idena ambassadors, advocates, local community leaders, influencers, and everyone who spreads the word about Idena, we introduce the Idena referral program! The program offers an opportunity to earn rewards for new validated identities they bring to the network.

### Referral program mechanics

- Apply for participation by submitting [Referral link request form](https://forms.gle/1R1AKZokEYn3aUU19). Get approved and get your personal referral link;
- Educate your community about Idena;
- Share your referral link, motivate your audience to join and help them to get an invite by tweeting about Idena;
- Help your invitees through the onboarding process, remind them about the validation ceremony and help them get validated;
- After the validation ceremony contact the core team and get rewarded for each validated identity referred by you.

The identity is considered a referee if the following conditions are met:

- the referee opened https://www.idena.io/join-idena with your referral link;
- the referee has received an invite via Twitter on https://www.idena.io/join-idena;
- the referee has successfully activated the invite and passed the following validation.

### Rewards

The reward for a validated invite depends on the validation success rate of the affiliate.

| Validation success rate | Reward for one validated invite  |
| ------------ | ------------ |
|  Less than 40% |  10 iDNA |
|  40-75% | 20 iDNA  |
|  75-90% | 50 iDNA  |
|  More than 90%| 100 iDNA  |

The validation success rate of the affiliate is calculated as follows:

`Validation success rate = ( Number of validated invites / Number of issued invites ) * 100%`

Important:

> To get rewarded, the affiliate should own an identity validated for the epoch when the invites are shared. The affiliate submits the address of this identity in the application form above as payment address. If the identity of the payment adress is not validated, the reward will not be paid.

**The reward fund is limited to 20 000 iDNA. The payment order is determined by the invite issue time: earlier invites are rewarded first.**


*The Idena team reserves the rights to change and adjust these terms in case necessary.*
