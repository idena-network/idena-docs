# Idena Improvement Proposals

If you wish to submit IIP, first propose your idea to [Github discussion](https://github.com/idena-network/idena-docs/discussions) or Idena discord #platform-suggestions.
After discussion, please open a PR. After copy-editing and acceptance, it will be published here.

Having a IIP here does not make it a formally accepted standard until its status becomes Final.
