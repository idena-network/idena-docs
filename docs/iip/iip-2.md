### Abstract

Change the time of validation ceremony from 13:30 UTC to 15:00 UTC

### Motivation

This proposal is aimed to make the time of the validation ceremony more convenient for people located in the US. There's a lot of active crypto users in the western part of the US. Now they have validation at 5:30 AM which is very inconvenient. That is a major limiting factor for the adoption of Idena in the US.

### Specification

New validation time for different time zones:

- GMT 15:00
- San Francisco, USA 7:00
- New York, USA 11:00
- Tunis, Tunisia 16:00
- Cairo, Egypt 17:00
- Berlin, Germany 16:00
- Moscow, Russia 18:00
- Delhi, India 20:30
- Jakarta, Indonesia 22:00
- Beijing, China 23:00
- Sydney, Australia 01:00 + 1 day
- Auckland, New Zealand 03:00 + 1 day
- Honolulu, Hawaii, USA 05:00 + 1 day

### Security Considerations

There are no risks for the Idena protocol associated with this proposal.
