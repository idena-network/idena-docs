### Abstract

Discriminate the voting power of pool delegators and newly validated identities.

### Motivation

The motivation behind this proposal is fueled by large pools being able to undelegate a significant number of identities that instantly regain voting powers. Those identities can then vote in a coordinated manner and incline the outcome of an oracle or fork voting. This can also be used to manipulate the funds of an oracle lock. 

One of the principles pools were designed on is "Accounts included in a pool (delegated accounts) should be excluded from the decision-making process, oracle voting, block confirmation keeping the poolâ€™s rewards at the same level as if it were separate accounts."

### Specification

After undelegating or passing the first validation (reaching age 1), identities will have to wait at least one month (or 2 epochs if they represent more than that).    
To calculate the time an identity will have to wait before gaining voting powers, the following is calculated: 

`x=max(2592000,epoch_duration*2)`   
where:  
2592000 = 1 month (30 days) in seconds   
epoch_duration = epoch duration in seconds in which undelegation took place `OR` epoch duration in seconds in which the identity reached age 1

**For undelegated identities:** `x` is added to the timestamp of the block with the 'List of mining identities was updated' flag in which the identity's mining status was changed from delegated to undelegated.   
**For newly validated identities:** `x` is added to the timestamp of the block they first become validated in (this would be the block changing the epoch).

### Rationale

Having an identity wait for 2 epochs (if they are newly validated or just undelegated) before taking part in governing the network (or 1 month if 2 epochs represent less) would give enough time for a fork or oracle voting to expire thus pools won't be able to prepare any kind of setup where they'd be able to take part in a voting.

Newly validated identities have to be discriminated in order to remove the possibility of pools re-inviting their identities to take part in a voting.     
This would also make older identities more valuable and would incentivize people to not terminate their identity.

Even though at the writing of the proposal the network size is big enough for epochs to be over 15 days, it was taken into consideration that a small network having the epoch duration of 3 days, for example, would not benefit from the proposed change as the calculated timeout period would be 6 days, not enough to prevent this kind manipulation.  

Permanently removing voting powers from pool delegators was also considered, but this may incentivize people to terminate their identity once they decide to leave a pool and host a node for themselves, in order to regain their voting power.   

An example where this kind of scenario happened was on 17th November 2021 (during a hard fork voting).    
The voting number was stagnating right below the threshold for the hard fork to be activated. Two pools performed an operation where a significant number of identities undelegated, turned on mining (voted on the hard fork), and after the hard fork was activated redelegated to their pools.  
Reference blocks where some of the related transactions were confirmed:
`3636579`,`3636615`,`3636660` and `3636661` (undelegation); `3636606`,`3636653`,`3636654`,`3636706` (mining status turned on); `3636769` (hard fork activation); `3636871`,`3636872` and `3636873` (redelegation)      
Even if this was done with good intentions, it proved pools can still take part in the governance of the network which is against the vision of Idena pools.

### Security Considerations

The security of forks and oracle votings (oracle votings may be tied to governance or fund management, i.e. polls regarding protocol changes and oracle locks respectively) is increased by eliminating the possibility of pools undelegating their identities or re-inviting themselves with different addresses and manipulating the outcome of a voting. This would also prevent a potential bad actor from trying to gather up a significant number of identities and perform the same form of attack.
