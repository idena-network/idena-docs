# Running Shared Idena Node

If you want to run a shared Idena node, please follow these steps:
 - Deploy a new Idena node on VPS
 Follow this guide if you need help: [Shared node setup on VPS - a guide by Mahmoud and Rioda](https://idena.site/faq.php#shared-node-setup-on-vps). If you are familiar with Ansible, there is [a comprehensive collection of Playbooks](https://github.com/ltraveler/idena-sibling) available to [install and manage your Shared node](https://medium.com/idena/6ff31873101b) by LTraveler.
 - [Fill out the form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe1CiBmlynqNp2rnUlSWPFLTQ5I4BlIQWoCJ8ZTjAF7coGH7w/viewform?entry.900154518=https://t.me/&entry.1478741470=https://&entry.19432100=1) to add your shared node to the shared node marketplace in the Idena Web App.

Attach a csv file with API keys for the next epochs to your application form. The file should be in the following format:
```
key,epoch
e0898a015ffea03675cc3ecec3c17763,66
2d81e277eb852ed8dd8906c2c9cc83f2,66
2a7a1ef4eb8861af075fd841f41fffb4,67
8a806ce298846a8ed3396fb98b8faee8,67
56e26fd884f7d7455463db5570220dac,68
a7820a66f88674ce0da374d22a072a59,68
```
*Please adhere to this format. The applications with wrongly formated API key files can be turned down.* 

If you have filled the application correctly, we will add your node to the marketplace shortly.
Please make sure your node is online and the API keys are working before you submit the form because we check the nodes before listing.

If you want to update your shared node details or submit new keys, please use the same form and select "Update my shared node details" option.
